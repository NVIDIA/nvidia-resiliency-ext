class RankFilter(abc.ABC):
    r"""
    :py:class:`RankFilter` selects which ranks are active in the current
    restart iteration of :py:class:`inprocess.Wrapper`.

    Active ranks call the provided wrapped function. Inactive ranks are waiting
    idle, and could serve as a pool of static, preallocated and preinitialized
    spare ranks. Spare ranks would be activated in a subsequent restart
    iteration if previously active ranks were terminated or became unhealthy.

    Multiple instances of :py:class:`RankFilter` could be composed with
    :py:class:`inprocess.Compose` to achieve the desired behavior.
