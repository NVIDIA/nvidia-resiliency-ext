class Finalize(abc.ABC):
    r'''
    Abstract base class for ``finalize`` argument for
    :py:class:`inprocess.Wrapper`.

    :py:class:`Finalize` brings the process into a state where a restart of the
    wrapped function may be attempted, e.g.: deinitialize any global variables
    or synchronize with any asynchronous tasks issued by the wrapped function
    that was not already performed by exception handlers in the wrapped
    function.

    Any failure during execution of :py:class:`Finalize` should raise an
    exception. In this case the health check is skipped, exception is reraised
    by the wrapper, and it should cause termination of the main Python
    interpreter process.

    :py:class:`Finalize` class is executed after a fault was detected,
    distributed group was destroyed, but before the
    :py:class:`inprocess.health_check.HealthCheck` is performed.

    Multiple instances of :py:class:`Finalize` could be composed with
    :py:class:`inprocess.Compose` to achieve the desired behavior.
