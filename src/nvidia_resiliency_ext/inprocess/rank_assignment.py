class FillGaps(RankAssignment):

    A class for reassigning distributed ranks, filling in gaps caused by
    terminated or unhealthy ranks.

    The :py:class:`FillGaps` class is a specialized rank assignment strategy
    that reorders ranks to fill gaps created by terminated or unhealthy ranks.
    It preserves the previous rank assignment for the first ``world_size -
    len(terminated_ranks)`` healthy ranks; the remaining healthy ranks are
    reassigned to fill in gaps left by unhealthy ranks.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

class ShiftRanks(RankAssignment):
    r"""
    A class for reassigning distributed ranks, filling in gaps caused by

    The :py:class:`ShiftRanks` class is a specialized rank assignment strategy
    that shifts all healthy ranks to the left to fill gaps created by
    terminated or unhealthy ranks. :py:class:`ShiftRanks` preserves the
    relative order of all healthy ranks, but all ranks past the first unhealthy
    rank are reassigned (shifted).

class FilterGroupedByKey(RankAssignment):
    r"""
    A class for filtering distributed ranks by grouping by a key.

    :py:class:`FilterGroupedByKey` organizes ranks into groups based on a
    specified string key. For each group, it increments a group counter by 1
    for every healthy rank. A given boolean ``condition`` is then evaluated for
    each rank, with the corresponding group counter passed as input.

    - If ``condition(group_counter)`` evaluates to ``True``, the rank is
      preserved.
    - If it evaluates to ``False``, the rank is considered unhealthy and marked
      for termination.

    :py:class:`FilterGroupedByKey` needs to be followed by another
    :py:class:`RankAssignment` that performs the actual rank termination by
    raising :py:exc:`RankDiscarded` exception.

        # corresponding to a given hostname are in a healthy state, if the
        # count is different than 8, all ranks from corresponding hostname are
        # considered unhealthy, and terminated; remaining healthy ranks are
