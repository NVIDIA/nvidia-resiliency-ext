"""
SLURM by default terminates all user processes when the main job process is
finished. This also immediately terminates inprocess.MonitorProcess and
prevents it from submitting information to distributed store, and finalizing
iteration by waiting on termination barrier.

This script waits for all "python" processes launched by the current user to
finish before terminating the SLURM job, or waits for a given list of PIDs if provided in a file.
