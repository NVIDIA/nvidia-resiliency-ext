# NVIDIA Resiliency Extension

The NVIDIA Resiliency Extension (NVRx) integrates multiple resiliency-focused solutions for PyTorch-based workloads.

## Core Components and Capabilities

- **Fault Tolerance**
  - Detection of hung ranks.  
  - Restarting training in-job, without the need to reallocate SLURM nodes.

- **In-Process Restarting**
  - Detecting failures and enabling quick recovery.

- **Async Checkpointing**
  - Providing an efficient framework for asynchronous checkpointing.

- **Local Checkpointing**
  - Providing an efficient framework for local checkpointing.

- **Straggler Detection**
  - Monitoring GPU and CPU performance of ranks.  
  - Identifying slower ranks that may impede overall training efficiency.

- **PyTorch Lightning Callbacks**
  - Facilitating seamless NVRx integration with PyTorch Lightning.
